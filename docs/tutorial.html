		<h1>TxMaker</h1>
		<p>
			<i>TxMaker</i> is an application to convert different image formats
			to <i>tx</i> format as <i>Tx Manager</i> of <i>Arnold</i> does in
			<i>Maya</i>. The actual purpose of this application is to make it
			easier to convert the formats from outside of Maya. It means you don't
			need to open Maya to convert the image formats to tx format. All
			you need is to tell the path to directory containing texture files
			to TxMaker, it will convert and place the new files in the same 
			directory as <i>Tx Manager</i> does in Maya.

			You can convert the image formats in a controled way, you can tell
			TxMaker which images to convert and with what power of your processor.
			For exmaple, once you told the textures directory, the TxMaker will
			list all the available images in the specified directory.
			You can select any number of files to convert them to tx format,
			<i>Select All</i> option can be used to convert all the listed files
			to tx format.

			<br>
			The <i>Quick Make</i> option lets you select whether you want to
			convert the images quickly or with normal speed. When this option is
			checked, the TxMaker will utilize 100% of your processor power to
			convert the formats. Use this option when you think that you don't
			have any other work to do when converting the images. Because this
			option will consume all the processor power.

		<p>
			When done with all the options, click the <i>Make</i> button on the
			window, it will start converting the images, showing you the
			current state of the conversion at the top of Make button.
